	 deflateInit() function; in this case, however, we'll use deflateInit2() so
	 that the compressed data will have gzip headers. This will make it easy to
	 decompress the data later using a tool like gunzip, WinZip, etc.
	 
	 deflateInit2() accepts many parameters, the first of which is a C struct of
	 type "z_stream" defined in zlib.h. The properties of this struct are used to
	 control how the compression algorithms work. z_stream is also used to
	 maintain pointers to the "input" and "output" byte buffers (next_in/out) as
	 well as information about how many bytes have been processed, how many are
	 left to process, etc. */

	 The parameters are as follows:
	 
	 z_streamp strm - Pointer to a zstream struct
	 int level      - Compression level. Must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between
	 0 and 9: 1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives
	 no compression.
	 int method     - Compression method. Only method supported is "Z_DEFLATED".
	 int windowBits - Base two logarithm of the maximum window size (the size of
	 the history buffer). It should be in the range 8..15. Add
	 16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer
	 around the compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper. The
	 gzip header will have no file name, no extra data, no comment,
	 no modification time (set to zero), no header crc, and the
	 operating system will be set to 255 (unknown).
	 int memLevel   - Amount of memory allocated for internal compression state.
	 1 uses minimum memory but is slow and reduces compression
	 ratio; 9 uses maximum memory for optimal speed. Default value
	 is 8.
	 int strategy   - Used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the value
	 Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data
	 produced by a filter (or predictor), or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to
	 force Huffman encoding only (no string match) */
