 Uses zlib to compress the given data. Note that gzip headers will be added so
 that the data can be easily decompressed using a tool like WinZip, gunzip, etc.
																			  
 Note: Special thanks to Robbie Hanson of Deusty Designs for sharing sample code
 showing how deflateInit2() can be used to make zlib generate a compressed file
 with gzip headers:
