/* 
 It is a very clean and elegant subclass of CCLayer that lets you pass-in an array 
 of layers and it will then create a smooth scroller. 
 Complete with the "snapping" effect. You can create screens with anything that can be added to a CCLayer.
 
 Additions since Giv Parvaneh version:
	1. Added ability to swipe above targetedTouchDelegates.
    2. Added touches lengths & screens properties.
	3. Added factory class method.
	4. Code cleanup.
	5. Added current page number indicator (iOS Style Dots) with positioning.
	6. moveToPage is public method.
	7. Standard pages numbering starting from zero: [0;totalScreens-1] instead of [1; totalScreens]
 
 Limitations: 
	1. Mac OS X not supported. (Note #ifndef wrappers ;) )
	2. Standard Touch Delegates will still receive touch events after layer starts sliding.
